#### A Nonsense Collection of Disgusting Codes

Code, that twists mind of the most experienced coders; program, that senior programmers fails to decrypt; & even the best software engineers think they need to go back to college; this repo contains gems like that. Welcome to the world of creepy codes. 

Most of the programs here are hell hard to understand what is going on inside. The source addresses provided with the codes contain useful details. [TutorialsPoint-CodingGround](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm) or [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages) has online code editors and compilers, which can be used to run these programs.
